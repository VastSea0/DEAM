## 🔖 v1.0.2-alpha – Smarter Gallery Filtering (June 25, 2025)

In this update, Notia becomes smarter and more organized with the introduction of intelligent folder filtering. Your gallery is now easier to explore, manage, and enjoy.

### ✨ New Features

- 🧠 **Smart Folder Filtering (AI-style preview):** Notia now detects subfolders like `Camera`, `Screenshots`, etc., and allows filtering based on folder structure.
- 💡 **Highlighted “AI-powered” section** in the gallery to guide users toward the smart filtering system.
- 🚀 **Tag suggestion logic** based on file paths and directory structure (static, early-stage AI simulation).
- 🔄 First-time **pulse animation** on smart filtering section draws attention to new features.

### 🪛 Improvements

- 📂 Directory picker in Settings now updates the gallery in real time.
- 🖼️ Photo count display now reflects both filtered and total images.
- ⚙️ Optimized image loading with parallel file validation and better filtering performance.

### 🐞 Known Limitations

- ❗ “AI-powered” features are currently logic-based, not machine learning (ML will come in future versions).
- 🔄 Language switching doesn’t reset feature highlights (planned for v1.0.3).
- 🧪 Still in alpha: some UI elements may change or behave unexpectedly.

### 🧭 Coming Soon (v1.0.3+ roadmap)

- 🤖 True AI-powered screenshot & camera classification with offline models.
- 📍 Location-based photo sorting.
- 📝 Richer photo note editing (Markdown + embedded images).
- ☁️ Secure backup/sync (encrypted & offline-first model).
